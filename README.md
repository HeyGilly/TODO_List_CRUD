### Personal Statement
While building this application, I learned many new properties and methods that have to do with HTML DOM elements. Thanks to w3school with a list of properties, I now understand the real potential of what Javascript can do. I now have a better understanding of (createElement, appendChild, remove())  properties
`https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_all.asp`
There were many other sites I was able to get help from, however the w3school was the best one to have a better understanding how and what these methods are.
